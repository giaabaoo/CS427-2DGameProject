The only way to beat this powerful monster is to attack on its weakness(the eye). The demon power was expressed by its eyes and when the monster's eyes change to red, it is about to die. Moreoever, the demon has a special ability to shoot a sequence of lighting ball which will automatically trace any moving objects inside its living place. It was rumoured that the boss lives in a small cave which is located near a waterfall and the boss's balls can destroy anybody on its way of flying.
